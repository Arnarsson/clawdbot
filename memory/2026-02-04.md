# 2026-02-04 Session: Briefings Phase 1 Completion

## Summary
Completed Clawdbot Briefings Phase 1 implementation using subagent-driven development with parallel execution waves.

## Work Completed

### Briefings System - Phase 1 (10 commits)
1. **Cron Service Integration** (`src/briefings/cron-integration.ts`)
   - Wired up actual cron scheduling for briefings
   - Uses proper `CronJobCreate` type with `name`, `schedule: CronSchedule`, `sessionTarget`, `wakeMode`, `payload`
   - Fixed type mismatch: API uses `name` not `title`, and `schedule` must be `{kind: "cron", expr: "..."}` not plain string

2. **Runtime Bootstrap** (`src/briefings/runtime-init.ts`)
   - `initializeBriefingScheduler()` function for auto-start with bot
   - Graceful shutdown via returned handle

3. **Teams Canvas Integration** (`src/teams/canvas-integration.ts`)
   - Adaptive Cards v1.4 schema
   - `canvasToTeamsAdaptiveCard()` and `sendTeamsCanvas()` functions

4. **Zalo Canvas Integration** (`src/zalo/canvas-integration.ts`)
   - Markdown-style text formatting
   - `canvasToZaloMessage()` and `sendZaloCanvas()` functions

5. **Canvas Router Updates** (`src/canvas/router.ts`)
   - Added Teams and Zalo cases to `renderCanvas()`

6. **Config Validation Tests** - Phase2Config briefing options
7. **Integration Tests** - 9 comprehensive tests for full system
8. **Documentation** - `docs/briefings.md` user guide

### Key Technical Decisions
- CronService uses `CronSchedule` type: `{kind: "cron", expr: "0 8 * * *"}` not plain strings
- Briefing jobs use `sessionTarget: "main"` and `wakeMode: "now"`
- Payload format: `{kind: "systemEvent", text: "dispatch-briefing:morning"}`

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/teams/canvas-integration.test.ts` (new)
- `src/zalo/canvas-integration.ts` (new)
- `src/zalo/canvas-integration.test.ts` (new)
- `src/canvas/router.ts` (modified - added Teams/Zalo)
- `src/__tests__/briefings-phase1-integration.test.ts` (new)
- `docs/briefings.md` (new)

- `src/memory/jarvis-writer.ts` (fixed ts-expect-error)

### Pre-existing Test Failures (Not from this work)
- `phase2-4-integration.test.ts` - Memory extraction returns undefined
- `provider-usage.test.ts` - Format changed from "40% left" to "60% used"
- `jarvis-writer.test.ts` - Jarvis API returns 500
- `memory-lancedb/index.test.ts` - Config schema issues

## Errors Encountered

### EUREKA LLM Request Rejected
```
[EUREKA] LLM request rejected: messages.49: tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks immediately after: call_70378785
```
- Means a tool_use block wasn't followed by corresponding tool_result
- Usually caused by interrupted tool calls or conversation state sync issues
- Fix: Clear session and restart

### Git Push Permission
- HTTPS push to clawdbot/clawdbot.git denied for user "Arnarsson"
- Workaround: Added remote `arnarsson` pointing to fork and pushed there

## EUREKA Session (11:34 - 12:13)

### Overview
EUREKA ran a massive parallel agent sprint with 100+ Sonnet agents across 5 projects, with 3 Opus coordinators. Session ended with LLM error loop.

### Agent Distribution
| Project | Agents | Completed | Key Work |
|---------|--------|-----------|----------|
| SourceTrace | 52 | 12+ | SSO, Warehouse, Account Tracking, Whitelabel, Referral, Claude AI, GEO API, Rate Tiers, 25 Integrations, Heatmaps, SDK |
| Jarvis Dashboard | 15 | 2+ | Issue Detail, Timeline Clustering, Voice Commands, Calendar, OKRs widget |
| RecruitOS | 12 | 0 | ATS Integrations (Greenhouse/Lever), Chrome Ext, Video, Assessments |
| agent.tips | 10 | 0 | Newsletter (Buttondown), Affiliate, Job Board, Discovery Pipeline |
| Personal/Clawdbot | 11 | 0 | LinkedIn Auth, Home Assistant, GTM Strategy, Second Brain |

### Build Fixes Applied
- **SourceTrace**: Fixed JSON comma in root `package.json`, removed trailing `""` in telegram devDeps
- **Jarvis**: Clean Vite build (1.47MB JS, 130KB CSS)
- **RecruitOS**: Fixed `error.errors` → `error.issues` in all `app/api/*.ts` (Zod API drift)
- **agent.tips**: Already clean

### Features Claimed Complete
- **SourceTrace**: Python SDK (`pip install sourcetrace`), JS SDK (`@sourcetrace/sdk`), Heatmaps (click/scroll/attention), User Segments, Goal Funnels, Event Builder UI, Status Page, Discord/Slack integrations, SOC 2 Type II prep (6 policies)
- **Jarvis**: Timeline clustering, Voice commands (⌘⇧V), Calendar widget, OKRs widget, Eureka's Take component
- **Personal**: LinkedIn Auth (Playwright storage_state), Second Brain (PARA vault), Energy Mapping schedule, Smart Interrupt Filter

### Session Failure
At 11:59, EUREKA hit an LLM error loop:
```
LLM request rejected: messages.49: tool_use ids were found without tool_result blocks immediately after: call_70378785
```
- Error repeated on every message
- `/stop` killed 2 sub-agents but error persisted
- `/restart` was disabled
- Session became unresponsive

### Root Cause
A tool call (ID: call_70378785) was interrupted mid-execution, leaving the conversation state corrupted. The Claude API requires every `tool_use` to have a matching `tool_result` in the next message. When this pairing breaks, the session cannot recover without clearing/resetting.

### Lessons Learned
1. Massive parallel agent spawning (100+) can overload conversation state
2. Need killswitch that actually clears session state, not just stops agents
3. Build verification should happen before claiming completions
4. Consider checkpointing conversation state before large spawns
